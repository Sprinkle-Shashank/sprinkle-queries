  The table only shows those Factories/Location which has a ongoing batch or no batch. The ongoing Batch is one in which "Batch Start" OR "Batch end" OR "Business outcome Tracking" section has not been submitted. Hence, it would also show factories where no batches are running.

Rearrange the columns as given here

Show this when a batch is ongoing (end_date_2 == null in Batch (4227) Profile) or there is no batch currently when pace_status = 845114 in Factory- Sustainability Rating (Monthly) (54267). Both profiles are in same project.
